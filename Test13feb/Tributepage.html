        <h3>A Short Biography of Lata Mangeshkar ji</h3>
        
        <ul>
             <li>
                Mangeshkar was born in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family[15] in 1929, the eldest daughter of Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi and Konkani musician, and his wife Shevanti[16] in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India)
            </li>
            <li>
                Her father, Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a classical singer and theatre actor. Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a Gujarati woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra), was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died, was Shevanti's older sister.[17]
            </li>
            <li>
                Her paternal grandfather, Ganesh Bhatt Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), was a priest who performed the abhishekam of the Shiva lingam at the Mangueshi Temple in Goa.[18] Her paternal grandmother, Yesubai Rane, was from Goa. Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.[19]
            </li>
            <li>
                Deenanath adopted the surname Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town of Mangeshi, Goa. Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, भाव बंधन.[20]
            <li>
                She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On her first day of school,[20] Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her sister Asha along with her.[22]
